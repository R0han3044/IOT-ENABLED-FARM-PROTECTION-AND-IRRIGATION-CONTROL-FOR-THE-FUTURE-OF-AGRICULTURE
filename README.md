# ðŸŒ± IoT Enabled Farm Protection and Irrigation Control for the Future of Agriculture ðŸŒ±

> **Protect, Monitor, and Manage Your Farm with Smart IoT Technology â€” All in Real Time.**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description ðŸ”¹

This project aims to **enhance agricultural practices by employing IoT technologies** for both farm protection and irrigation control.  
Using sensors, cameras, and automation, it helps farmers:

- Detect intruders (animals or unauthorized persons) and send alerts in real time.
- Monitor soil moisture and control irrigation remotely.
- Improve yields, reduce water waste, and enable sustainable agricultural practices.
